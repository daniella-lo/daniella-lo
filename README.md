ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniella, an aquatic biologist, currently studying how :fish: are able to adapt to low oxygen in streams and wetlands.

You can find out more about my research [here](http://daniella-lo.github.io)

I'm interested, broadly, in countering the perspective of scarcity, empowering people through :bar_chart:  science and data, and connecting people to place to bring about resilience, both social :raised_hands:  and ecological :seedling:.
